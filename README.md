# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Deep Learning

## Context :
  + It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

## Objectives of this Code
  + Goal of this project is to construct models to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent.

## Machine Learning Model Used
  + Convolutional Neural Network

## Steps Followed
  + ‚Å†Process Data: Prepare and clean data for analysis.
  + Build Deep Learning Model: Experiment with different architectures and fine-tune parameters.
  + Train and Validate: Split data strategically and address class imbalance.
  + Evaluate Performance: Focus on AUC-ROC, with additional metrics for better understanding.

## Dataset Description
 + Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download
 + This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
 + Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
